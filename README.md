# S2-EN1094
 Engineering Design Project Semester 02

Back in my early days in the department (second semester), I had the opportunity to work on an innovative project under the module EN1094. Our team decided to address a major issue that many people experienced at the time: the unavailability and high expense of fuel gasoline.
To solve this, we set out to create a long-term solution: a coconut shell stove.

Choosing this project was an eye-opening experience because we found the major problems involved with traditional coconut shell stoves. These stoves took an inordinate amount of time to light the charcoal, and once lit, they lacked an efficient mechanism of controlling the temperature.

With our collective enthusiasm and determination, we devised an ingenious solution: a hearth equipped with a DC fan to precisely control the heat output based on user input. The system operated on a 12V DC fan and incorporated a MAX6675 temperature sensor to monitor and maintain the desired temperature levels.

The result of our hard work was remarkable!

We succeeded in offering users six different temperature ranges, allowing them to select the most suitable one based on their specific needs. As we valued user interaction and feedback, we incorporated an OLED display and a buzzer as indicators to enhance the overall user experience.

Working in a team( with Dulini Himeka , Selani Indrapala , Jathurshan S. ) was an amazing experience! We collaborated closely, sharing ideas and supporting one another throughout the project's development. It was inspiring to witness the power of teamwork in overcoming challenges and achieving our common goal.

Presenting our hearth project at the end of the semester was a moment of immense pride and accomplishment. Not only we created an innovative solution to a real-world problem, but we also gained valuable insights into the realm of electronic design.

This project served as my first step into the world of electronic design, sparking my passion for technology and the limitless possibilities it offers. I am immensely grateful for the hands-on experience, the challenges, and the camaraderie that defined this journey.

Looking back, I cherish the memories of working together with my talented team, pushing the boundaries of creativity and engineering knowledge. The success of our hearth project on both technical and collaborative fronts has motivated me to pursue further electronic design projects, fostering a desire to continually learn and create impactful solutions for the world.
